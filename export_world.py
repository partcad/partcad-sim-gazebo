"""The Gazebo world exporter (declared under 'export:' in partcad.yaml beside this).

Writes a PartCAD scene -- or any other shape -- as an SDFormat ``.world`` file
plus the mesh files it references. This is the format PartCAD calls ``world``,
after the files it lives in. "SDF" is overloaded and the two meanings are
unrelated: the ``sdf`` *part* type is a signed distance function, while this is
**SDFormat**, the XML dialect Gazebo describes a simulation world in.

Like the URDF exporter beside it, this one is handed the assembly *tree* itself
rather than the geometry it decodes to -- which is what ``decode: false`` on
this format's declaration asks for, see 'wrappers/wrapper_export.py' in PartCAD
itself. Decoding
would keep the tree's shape and nothing else about it: every node's ``name`` and
``label`` is dropped and its placement is baked into the geometry rather than
staying readable as data. This exporter needs all three, because that is what
the models, the links, the poses and the properties are built from.

The mapping is the reverse of the world reader's ('import_world.py' beside this):

  * the exported object is the ``<world>``,
  * anything placed in it is a ``<model>``, and a node with a subtree is a
    ``<model>`` wherever it sits -- SDFormat has no other container,
  * a node that is geometry is a ``<link>`` with a ``<visual>`` and a
    ``<collision>``, both referencing a mesh written next to the world file.

Two conventions are worth stating, because they are what makes the round trip
close, and both are the ones the URDF exporter already uses:

  * Meshes are written in millimetres -- the unit PartCAD uses everywhere --
    and referenced with ``<scale>0.001 0.001 0.001</scale>``, which is how
    SDFormat says "these coordinates are millimetres". Poses are in metres and
    radians, as SDFormat requires.
  * Geometry is written in its own frame and placed by the element that holds
    it, so a ``<visual>`` origin stays at identity. A shape that appears more
    than once is written once and referenced by every link that uses it.

What the part states about itself wins over anything computed here: mass,
centre of mass, inertia, friction, contact and colour are named PartCAD
properties, and this writes each of them into the SDFormat element that states
it. Only a part that says nothing gets computed inertial properties, from its
solid and the configured density. A property PartCAD has and SDFormat has no
spelling for is reported rather than dropped in silence -- see SDF_STATED.
