"""SDFormat (Gazebo) conventions: poses, geometry, and the vocabulary tables.

Shared by the world reader ('import_world.py'), the world exporter
('export_world.py') and anything else in this package that has to read or write
a pose. Dependency-free -- no OCP, no XML schema, nothing but the standard
library and PartCAD's own 'urdf_common' -- so it can be imported and unit-tested
on its own.

"SDF" is overloaded in PartCAD and the two meanings are unrelated. The 'sdf'
*part* type is a signed distance function, which PartCAD evaluates and which
has nothing to do with any of this. This
module is about **SDFormat**, the XML dialect Gazebo describes simulation
worlds in, and PartCAD calls that one ``world`` after the ``.world`` files it
lives in -- which is also the identifier a scene is exported to it under. Where
this module says "SDF" it always means SDFormat.

SDFormat states a pose exactly as URDF states an ``<origin>``: a translation
and a fixed-axis roll-pitch-yaw triple, in metres and radians. So the pose
maths is 'urdf_common''s, unchanged, and only the spelling differs -- six
numbers in one element rather than two attributes. Two SDF-only spellings are
handled here because they appear in real files: ``degrees="true"`` and
``rotation_format="quat_xyzw"``.
